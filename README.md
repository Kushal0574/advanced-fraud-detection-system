# Advanced Fraud Detection System

This is a full-stack, production-style Fraud Detection System built using Python, Java, AI/ML, Apache Kafka, JWT security, and a React frontend.
The system processes transactions in real time using Kafka streams and evaluates fraud risk using a machine learning model served via a Python microservice.
A Java Spring Boot backend handles authentication, authorization (JWT), transaction ingestion, and communication with Kafka and the ML service.
The React frontend provides a simple dashboard interface for submitting and monitoring transactions securely.
The entire application is containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to run locally or deploy to cloud environments.

Tech Stack: Python (Flask, ML), Java (Spring Boot), Apache Kafka, JWT, PostgreSQL, React, Docker.
